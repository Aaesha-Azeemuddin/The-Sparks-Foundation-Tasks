# The-Sparks-Foundation-Tasks

This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern for [The Sparks Foundation](https://www.thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/).

- **Internship Category -** Data Science and Business Analytics

- **Internship Duration -** 1 Month ( January-2024 )

- **Internship Type -** Work from Home

In this internship, we were provided with few of the tasks which were to be completed in the given time frame. 

# Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)

1. Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
2. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
3. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w
4. You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
5. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

# Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)

1. From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
2. Use R or Python or perform this task.
3. Data can be found at https://bit.ly/3cGyP8j

# Task-3 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm(Level - Intermediate)

1. For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
2. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
